            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, also known as Netaji, was an Indian revolutionary who played a significant role in India's independence movement. He was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, Orissa, to Prabhavati Dutt Bose and Janakinath Bose. Bose studied at the Presidency College and the Scottish Churches College in Calcutta. He was a participant of the noncooperation movement and a leader of the Indian National Congress, known for his advocacy of socialist policies. He led an Indian national force of around 40,000 troops against the Western powers during World War II but was defeated and forced to retreat. Bose's wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.1 He is famously known as the founder of 'Azad Hind Fauj' and his famous slogan is 'Tum Mujhe Khoon Do, Main Tumhe Aazadi Dunga'. He died on 18 August 1945 in a hospital in Taiwan after suffering from burn injuries sustained in a plane crash.</p>
